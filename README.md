## Getting more voices

Natural Speech is able to use your operating system's text-to-speech (On Windows and MacOS), but you can get more voices by installing additional engines.

You can install additional voices by installing languages on your operating system:
- [Windows Instructions](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/topic/download-languages-and-voices-for-immersive-reader-read-mode-and-read-aloud-4c83a8d8-7486-42f7-8e46-2b0fdf753130)<br/>
- [MacOS Instructions](https://support.apple.com/en-ae/guide/mac-help/mchlp2290/mac)

You can install even more voices by installing additional TTS engines:
- **Windows:** You can get all voice engines easily through [the installer](https://github.com/TheLouisHong/natural-speech-installer/releases/tag/Installer).<br/>
- **Windows/MacOS/Linux:** You can set up the engines manually by following the instructions in [INSTALLING.md](INSTALLING.md)

## Setting up Natural Speech
The plugin should work out of the box with a few voices using your system's TTS capabilities.
if it doesn't, check the settings in the panel by clicking the button on the side:

At this point you might see a message indicating that there are no available voices installed.

Click on the **Voice Hub** button, where you should see atleast one available voice pack. Enable it.
