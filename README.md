## Getting more voices

Natural Speech is able to use your operating system's text-to-speech (On Windows and MacOS), but you can get more voices by installing additional engines. You can download the installer, or you install them manually by following the instructions in [INSTALLING.md](INSTALLING.md)

Make sure that under the `Play` and `Stop` control buttons the location of your piper installation is correct.
If it's not, piper will not work. To change it click on the browse button, and navigate to find `piper.exe` and press `Open`.

The button will get greyed out, the download will start and might take a while. Be patient.
