### Post installation notes

After Installing Piper you should be able to use TTS in-game once the voice pack is downloaded, and the engine has been started.

## Setting up Natural Speech
To set up Natural Speech, you will need to install a TTS engine, and download atleast one voice pack through the plugin's panel.

After intalling the plugin, open the panel by clicking the button on the side:

You should see a plugin panel looking like the screenshot below.

Make sure that under the `Play` and `Stop` control buttons the location of your piper installation is correct.
If it's not, piper will not work. To change it click on the browse button, and navigate to find `piper.exe` and press `Open`.

The button will get greyed out, the download will start and might take a while. Be patient.

After it's finished downloading, **toggle the repository on**.
